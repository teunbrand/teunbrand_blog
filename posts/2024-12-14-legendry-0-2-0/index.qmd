I now have the awkward pride of announcing a fresh update to an already new package, barely a month after its release.
On the one hand I did a little bit of future-proofing, hopefully preventing it from being kicked out of CRAN in the next half year.
On the other hand, I also developed a few features that I'm excited to share!

```{r}
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  dev = "ragg_png",
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

## Bubbles

The first thing I'd like to parade around is a new standalone guide for the `size` aesthetic.
The `guide_circles()` function lets you build a guide that displays the size of points as a series of rings.
Simultaneously is source of frustration, but also a neat thing is that this guide uses actual points drawn by the layer glyph function.
Taking the correct measurements of points and aligning them was a bit fussy to develop, but at least for circular points, it should work as you'd expect!

```{r}
library(legendry)

gapminder::gapminder |>
  dplyr::filter(year == max(year)) |>
  ggplot(aes(gdpPercap, lifeExp, size = pop, fill = continent)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21) +
  scale_size_area(
    # Note that we need irregular breaks because we scale area, not radius
    limits = c(0, NA), max_size = 20,
    breaks = c(0, 100, 500, 1000)*1e6,
    labels = c(0, "100M", "500M", "1B"),
    guide  = guide_circles(vjust = 1)
  ) +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(
    x = "GDP per capita",
    y = "Life expectancy",
    fill = "Continent",
    size = "Population"
  )
```

I hasten to mention that I'm not the first to develop such a guide, but I think that this is the first version that is implemented as a ggplot2 guide. See [scatterpie](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/scatterpie/vignettes/scatterpie.html) or [mapsf](https://riatelab.github.io/mapsf/#usage) for other implementations.

## Trees

The next addition in this release is a guide for dendrograms. 
There are plenty of better packages to plot dendrograms for the sake of dendrograms, like [dendextend](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dendextend).
Instead, legendry now has a new scale/guide pair whose job it is to display dendrograms as axis annotations.
I've personally enjoyed these annotations in combination with heatmaps.

The new scales `scale_x_dendro()` and `scale_y_dendro()` accept a `<hclust>` object generated from the eponymous function.
The scale itself just ensure that discrete categories are sorted by the dendrogram order.

It is the guide that comes with these scales, `guide_axis_dendro()` that does the heavy lifting of actually displaying the dendrogram.

```{r}
car_cor <- cor(t(mtcars), method = "spearman")
car_clusters <- hclust(as.dist(1 - car_cor))

data <- reshape2::melt(car_cor)

p <- ggplot(data, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_viridis_c() +
  scale_x_dendro(car_clusters, guide = guide_axis_dendro(labels = FALSE)) +
  scale_y_dendro(car_clusters) +
  labs(x = "Cars", y = "Cars", fill = expression(rho^2)) +
  guides(x.sec = guide_axis(angle = 90))

p + coord_fixed()
```

You may correctly point out that a similar thing already exists in the ggh4x package.
The primary difference is that `guide_axis_dendro()` uses legendry's gimmicks, such as [composed guides](https://teunbrand.github.io/legendry/articles/guide_composition.html).
This implies both that it is build on the newer guide system introduced in ggplot2 3.5.0 and that it works well with `coord_radial()`.

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(rownames(mtcars), mpg)) +
  geom_col(width = 1) +
  coord_radial(inner.radius = 0.5, expand = FALSE) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL) +
  scale_x_dendro(car_clusters) +
  guides(
    theta = guide_axis_base(angle = 90),
    theta.sec = guide_axis_dendro(labels = FALSE),
    r = "none"
  ) +
  theme(plot.margin = margin(t = 50, b = 50))
```

In one of the *very* rare cases that a secondary theta axis can be useful, the dendrogram guide can be placed in the center of polar plots.
These shennanigans make it easy to create visualisation like radiating [phylogenetic trees](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Phylogenetic_Tree_of_Life.png).

With all of that wrapped up, all that is left is wishing you all happy holidays!

```{r}
#| code-summary: "Session info"
si <- sessioninfo::session_info()
# Deidentifying paths on my personal machine
si$packages$library <- NULL
si$platform$pandoc <- NULL
print(si)
```
